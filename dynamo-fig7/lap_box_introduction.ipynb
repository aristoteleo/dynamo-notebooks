    "Toward $\\textit{à la carte}$ reprogramming: a least action path approach\n",
    "The least action path (LAP) principle, first proposed as early as 1744 by Maupertuis $\\citb{terrall}$ and famously advocated by Feynman with his reformulation of quantum mechanics via the path integral of the classical Hamilton action $\\citb{fey65}$, has previously been used in predicting the optimal transition path of cell fate transition for simplistic and designed systems $\\citb{Qiu2012-yt, Wang2014-zc, Wang8257}$ We reason that with  the reconstructed continuous, differentiable vector field, we can extend the LAP approach to real datasets in transcriptomic space to computationally explore optimal paths for differentiation and reprogramming (dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation), which then helps identify key transcription factors whose expression levels vary strongest along these paths. \n",
    "\n",
    "The transcriptomic vector field encodes dynamical information of pathways connecting different cell types. For the development, the developmental paths, connecting progenitors and stable cell types, such as HSCs and megakaryocytes (\\textbf{Fig. 7B}), are characterized by vector field streamlines, where cells need to overcome little to no dynamical barrier. On the contrary, the reversed process, dedifferentiation, requires cells to migrate against the streamline, overcome the developmental barrier to eventually become progenitors and reacquire multipotency. Stable cell types are attractors that are separated by attractor barriers (\\textbf{Box 1}, \\textbf{Fig. 1}), and during transdifferentiation processes, cells from one stable attractor overcome these barriers and transverse into another stable attractor. Overcoming the dedifferentiation/transdifferentiation barriers driven by stochasticity are \\textit{rare transitions}, as evidenced by extremely low experimental reprogramming efficiency, as low as 0.001–0.01\\% \\citb{Merkl2013}. This is why reprogramming factors are generally needed, which reshape the developmental landscape in favor of the reprogramming transitions. In the context of cell state transitions, there are two seemingly similar but fundamentally different concepts worth additional clarification:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- transition time: The expected waiting time for a cell to initiate and finish the transition between two states, regardless of the path it takes. This corresponds to the experimentally measured time for one cell type to commit into another.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- traversal time: The time the cell spends traveling along a specific path. Theoretically, this is the time for a single cell to complete the cell type conversion once the cell has decided on the commitment.\n",

    "Given the vector field function, $\\boldsymbol f$, optimal pathways of  cell fate conversion can be mathematically analyzed by least action paths (LAPs) \\citb{freidlin2012random, onsager1953, Maier1997}. The action is defined as:\n",

By this definition, a path that strictly follows a streamline of a vector field whose tangential velocity also equals the evaluated velocity of the vector field has zero action, whereas any deviation increases action. In other words, developmental processes are (mostly) a spontaneous process and driven by intrinsic cell states, whereas dedifferentiation requires external forces such as ectopic expression of exogenous TFs or specific chemical inductions. \n",

    "Computationally, given the starting and end cell states $\\boldsymbol x_0$ and $\\boldsymbol x_{n}$, such as HSCs and megakaryocytes (\\textbf{Fig. 7B}), and a specific traversal time $T$, the LAP can be found by discretizing the path as a sequence of points $P=\\{\\boldsymbol x_0, \\boldsymbol x_1, \\dots, \\boldsymbol x_n\\}$, which forms $n$ line segments.

    "For rare transitions with $S_{T^*} \\gg 0$ (e.g., dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation), the transition rate (number of transitions per unit time) is proportional to the exponential of actions of all paths. The Freidlin–Wentzell theorem dictates that the LAP with the minimal traversal time (which will be referred to as the optimal path below) contributes the most to this transition rate \\citb{freidlin2012random, onsager1953, Maier1997, Aurell2002}:\n",

    "where $A$ and $B$ are two cell types, $S_{T^*}$ the action of the optimal path, and $C$ a proportional factor. Furthermore, the transition time, or more specifically the mean first passage time (MFPT), is related to the transition rate:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\mathrm{MFPT} = \\frac{1}{R(A\\rightarrow B)}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Therefore, the action of the optimal path predicts both the likelihood and transition time for such rare transitions. Again, most reprogramming experiments take a few weeks or months, depending on the exact initial and terminal cell states \\cite{takahashi2006induction}. \n",
    "\n",
    "For natural transitions between points that are connected by the vector field streamlines (e.g., from a repulsor to an adjacent attractor), the actions of LAPs, within a certain range of $T$, are all zero, because a path following the streamline downstream is a LAP with zero action. The above approximation that the LAP contributes the most to the transition rate no longer applies. Differentiation processes are often close to such natural transitions, and the action of a differentiation LAP cannot tell us any information on the transition rate. However, LAPs are still the most probable paths for cells to take, as they are optimized to follow the streamline of the vector field. The waiting time for the cell to initiate the transition is negligible in this case, so the transition time can be approximated by the traversal time of the LAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the computation of transition time and traversal time, analyzing gene expression variations along LAPs provides essential information on regulatory genes, and their dynamics, during cell fate transitions. We calculate the mean squared displacement (MSD) for every gene $i$ along the optimal path:\n",
